First step is you wan't open up crosh, to do that you to simotaniously push " ctrl-alt-t "

when you have crosh upen you need to type in " shell "

you should get something that look's like this " chronos@localhost / $  "

if you get this text you are doing it correctly and need to type in " sudo su " 

you will get a new line that looks like this " localhost / #  "

next you will need to type in " cd home/root "

then you will get this as the result " localhost /home/root #  "

next you just need to type in " ls "

you will get this as a result
" 68ab9103c4f69a6a0eeeae8f12eb255c5f03d9e8  81dd595c869acf2263c447e6454fa7d1e4985f8f  e59235505729fbfa92ad0ca19982034c777df93a "

you want to highlight the center section of jiberish that is highlited in blue in your crosh window.
(highliting copys the text)

in your new command line you want to type in " cd " hit the space bar then input the text that you just highlited and hit ENTER

then type in " ls "

then type in " more shill/shill.profile "

then your going to get a whole lot of words on your screen, you want to hold down enter until you see a new commant line

when you do that you need to look for the wifi you want the password for

once you have that find where it says " Passphrase=rot47 (randomtext)"

what you see to the right of it is the randomtext and that is what you need.
it's not going to say random text on your screen, it will probably look something like this " :8C2?5A@E2E@_eg " this is mine

what you want to do in the final commant line is this " echo randomtext | tr '!-~' 'P-~!-O'

hit enter and you will get the password for that WiFi
